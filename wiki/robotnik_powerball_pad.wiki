==1. Package Summary==

Allows to use a pad with the robotnik_powerball_sim, sending the messages received through the joystick input, correctly adapted, to the "arm_controller/command". It is necessary to have correctly installed the [http://code.google.com/p/wsg50-ros-pkg WSG 50 package] to satisfy some dependencies, however, thanks to this we are able to test the Powerball with the gripper.
