Contains the different launch files of the different robots/environments (guardian, gball, robotnik,...).

===2.2. Media===

Contains the textures, models and scripts to represent the Robotnik simulated world incorporated in the package.

This folder has the meshes of the *basic* Guardian robot organized by part (chassis, wheel, others...) and by model (v5, v6, especial version...), so it allow easily changes in the URDF.
